# Builders_Square is my final project for COS3712 Graphics Programming

## I have built Builders_Square with JS + 3JS + Math + Logic + Years of Programming experience
## Built by hand, no external engines 

### Builders_Square is my take of a futuristic city with a dash of Cyberpunk and a twist of my love for horror.
